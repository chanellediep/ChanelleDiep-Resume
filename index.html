        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-BusinessðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi there! My name is Chanelle Diep, I am currently a first year student at University of California, Riverside. I am currently majoring in Pre-Business and plan on focus in the marketing department and I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. I hope to pursue a career in a marketing or public relations field. I was always inspired by women climbing the corporate ladder in a male dominated industry. The concept of growing a small business into a major corporation has always been intriguing to me. I am drawn to the idea of boardrooms and offices. I am looking forward to learning everything I can about business and marketing and making my own mark in the industry.<br><br>

        Growing up I knew that it was very important to have a great work ethic and work towards your goals. I have had a bunch of different jobs over the past few years. My first job was at a frozen yogurt shop when I was just fifteen and a half years old. I thought it was fun but very tiring. I also worked at a place called 7Leaves where they served boba drinks. I personally loved this place because I gained a lot of leadership experience. Since then I havve had a bunch of jobs that have helped me grow in different ways. I have learned how to communicate better, work in a fast-paced environment, and thnk quickly on my feet.<br><br>

        I come from a low income immigrant family which pushes me to work even harder throughout life. A major goal in my life is to succeed and make my family proud. I want them to never worrya bout bills or struggle financially. I think it would bring them great joy to see me succeed. Growing up I was forced to learn to be independent and mature, I knew every decision I made would affect my future. One of my favorite business women is Oprah Winfrey. She has become one of the richest female business leaders in America, and I aspire to become like her because she has paved a path for women in the Business field. To wrap it up, I will provide some interesting facts about me! Something I love are dogs. I have a Shiba and German Shepherd and I love them with all my heart. My Shiba is named Happy and my German Shepherd is named Rocket. Happy is 5 years old and Rocket is 4 years old and both of them like to go on walks. My hobby is volleyball and cheer. In highschool, I grew a large interest in volleyball because my friends introduced me to it and I loved it. I was also on the varsity cheer team and this was one of the best experiences because I got to cheer at many sporting events. In my free time, I love to read books. I feel that reading books brings a lot of suspense and it also expands my knowledge. My favorite book is the Harry Potter series.
